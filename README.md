## The German Genderstern

The [Genderstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_star) (lit. 'gender asterisk') is a typographic style used in gender-neutral German language that makes it possible to refer to all genders while also including non-binary people.

To make reading more pleasant and not interrupt the reading flow, the asterisk in this fork is aligned with the height of the lowercase letters.
